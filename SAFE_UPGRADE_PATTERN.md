# Safe Contract Upgrade Pattern

This file documents the implementation and optimization of the Safe Contract Upgrade Pattern for the StellarCert project.

## Summary
- Admin-only upgrade function following Stellar upgrade patterns
- ContractUpgraded event with new WASM hash reference
- Preservation of all certificate and issuer storage on upgrade
- Time-lock or multi-sig approval required before upgrade executes
- Upgrade procedure documented in UPGRADE_README.md
- Integration tests simulate upgrade scenarios
- Optimizations for storage, event emission, validation, and approval workflows

## Optimization Notes
- Storage operations are minimized and batched where possible
- Only essential events are emitted during upgrade
- Validation and approval workflows are streamlined for efficiency
- Compatibility matrices are cached to reduce storage reads

## Status
All requirements are implemented, tested, and optimized. No errors or warnings are present in the codebase.
